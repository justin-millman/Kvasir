# About the Name
The Norse mythological man **Kvasir** (/'kvɑ:sir/ *KVAHSS-eer*) was renowned as the wisest figure in the world. Formed
from the saliva the Æsir and Vanir, two warring groups of Gods, to cement their truce, Kvasir traveled the Nine Realms
teaching and spreading knowledge to all beings. Eventually, two mischievous svartálfar (basically dwarves) named Fjalar
and Galar killed Kvasir, drained his blood, and mixed that blood with honey to create the fabled Mead of Poetry. The
mead imbues the drinker with immense wisdom and the skills of a skald (a traditional Germanic bard). It was in this way
that Odin and Bragi bestowed poetry unto mankind.
