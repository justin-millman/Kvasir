    ///     The purpose of the <see cref="FullCheck"/> class is to provide a simple interface by which to evaluate the
    ///     full slate of API methods that describe equality and ordering for custom types. These functions are
    ///     generally expected to be internally consistent, but it can be tedious to manually evaluate each one
    ///     individually. This is exacerbated by the optionality of most elements of the API and the relative
    ///     difficulty of discovering their presence for an arbitrary type. The functions exposed by
    ///     <see cref="FullCheck"/> allow unit tests to succinctly express their intents without being concerned as to
    ///     the actual methods that are physically invoked.
    ///   </para>
    ///   <para>
    ///     When evaluating equality, <see cref="FullCheck"/> tests the most appropriate overload of any
    ///     <see langword="static"/> binary equality operators, the inherited <see cref="object.Equals(object?)"/>
    ///     method, and any strongly typed <c>Equals(T?)</c> methods brought in via <see cref="IEquatable{T}"/>.
    ///     Furthermore, if equality is expected, the <see cref="object.GetHashCode"/> method is evaluated as well.
    ///     Appropriate symmetry is assumed: i.e. if testing that <c>A</c> is equal to <c>B</c>,
    ///     <see cref="FullCheck"/> will also test that <c>B</c> is equal to <c>A</c>.
    ///   </para>
    ///   <para>
    ///     When evaluating ordering, <see cref="FullCheck"/> tests the most appropriate overload of any
    ///     <see langword="static"/> binary ordering operators and any strongly typed <c>CompareTo(T?)</c> methods
    ///     brought in via <see cref="IComparable{T}"/>. Note that neither <c>operator==</c> nor <c>operator!=</c> is
    ///     evaluated for ordering, as <i>equivalence</i> and <i>equality</i> are treated separately. Appropriate
    ///     symmetry is also assumed: i.e. if testing that <c>A</c> is strictly less than <c>B</c>,
    ///     <see cref="FullCheck"/> will also test that <c>B</c> is strictly greater than <c>A</c>.

    ///     testing framework or paradigm. To support the client's choice of testing platform, all of the APIs exposed
    ///     by <see cref="FullCheck"/> return an optional <see cref="string"/> denoting the result of the evaluation.
    ///     If the evaluation succeeds (i.e. the test passes), the optional will be a <c>NONE</c> instance. If, on the
    ///     other hand, the evaluation fails (i.e. the test fails), the optional will be a <c>SOME</c> instance that
    ///     contains the failed expression. This allows users to build thin adapters on top of the methods to handle
    ///     failure appropriately, including a useful error message if so desired.
