              A class that exposes <see langword="static"/> evaluation methods for checking user-defined equality and
              ordering APIs.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
              <para>
                The purpose of the <see cref="T:Atropos.FullCheck"/> class is to provide a simple interface by which to evaluate the
                full slate of API methods that describe equality and ordering for custom types. These functions are
                generally expected to be internally consistent, but it can be tedious to manually evaluate each one
                individually. This is exacerbated by the optionality of most elements of the API and the relative
                difficulty of discovering their presence for an arbitrary type. The functions exposed by
                <see cref="T:Atropos.FullCheck"/> allow unit tests to succinctly express their intents without being concerned as to
                the actual methods that are physically invoked.
              </para>
              <para>
                When evaluating equality, <see cref="T:Atropos.FullCheck"/> tests the most appropriate overload of any
                <see langword="static"/> binary equality operators, the inherited <see cref="M:System.Object.Equals(System.Object)"/>
                method, and any strongly typed <c>Equals(T?)</c> methods brought in via <see cref="T:System.IEquatable`1"/>.
                Furthermore, if equality is expected, the <see cref="M:System.Object.GetHashCode"/> method is evaluated as well.
                Appropriate symmetry is assumed: i.e. if testing that <c>A</c> is equal to <c>B</c>,
                <see cref="T:Atropos.FullCheck"/> will also test that <c>B</c> is equal to <c>A</c>.
              </para>
              <para>
                When evaluating ordering, <see cref="T:Atropos.FullCheck"/> tests the most appropriate overload of any
                <see langword="static"/> binary ordering operators and any strongly typed <c>CompareTo(T?)</c> methods
                brought in via <see cref="T:System.IComparable`1"/>. Note that neither <c>operator==</c> nor <c>operator!=</c> is
                evaluated for ordering, as <i>equivalence</i> and <i>equality</i> are treated separately. Appropriate
                symmetry is also assumed: i.e. if testing that <c>A</c> is strictly less than <c>B</c>,
                <see cref="T:Atropos.FullCheck"/> will also test that <c>B</c> is strictly greater than <c>A</c>.
              </para>
              <para>
                <see cref="T:Atropos.FullCheck"/> is intended as a utility for unit testing but is not tied to any particular unit
                testing framework or paradigm. To support the client's choice of testing platform, all of the APIs exposed
                by <see cref="T:Atropos.FullCheck"/> return an optional <see cref="T:System.String"/> denoting the result of the evaluation.
                If the evaluation succeeds (i.e. the test passes), the optional will be a <c>NONE</c> instance. If, on the
                other hand, the evaluation fails (i.e. the test fails), the optional will be a <c>SOME</c> instance that
                contains the failed expression. This allows users to build thin adapters on top of the methods to handle
                failure appropriately, including a useful error message if so desired.
