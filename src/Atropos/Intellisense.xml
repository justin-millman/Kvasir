              A class that exposes <see langword="static"/> evaluation methods for checking user-defined equality and
              ordering APIs.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
              <para>
                The purpose of the <see cref="T:Atropos.FullCheck"/> class is to provide a simple interface by which to evaluate the
                full slate of API methods that describe equality and ordering for custom types. These functions are
                generally expected to be internally consistent, but it can be tedious to manually evaluate each one
                individually. This is exacerbated by the optionality of most elements of the API and the relative
                difficulty of discovering their presence for an arbitrary type. The functions exposed by
                <see cref="T:Atropos.FullCheck"/> allow unit tests to succinctly express their intents without being concerned as to
                the actual methods that are physically invoked.
              </para>
              <para>
                When evaluating equality, <see cref="T:Atropos.FullCheck"/> tests the most appropriate overload of any
                <see langword="static"/> binary equality operators, the inherited <see cref="M:System.Object.Equals(System.Object)"/>
                method, and any strongly typed <c>Equals(T?)</c> methods brought in via <see cref="T:System.IEquatable`1"/>.
                Furthermore, if equality is expected, the <see cref="M:System.Object.GetHashCode"/> method is evaluated as well.
                Appropriate symmetry is assumed: i.e. if testing that <c>A</c> is equal to <c>B</c>,
                <see cref="T:Atropos.FullCheck"/> will also test that <c>B</c> is equal to <c>A</c>.
              </para>
              <para>
                When evaluating ordering, <see cref="T:Atropos.FullCheck"/> tests the most appropriate overload of any
                <see langword="static"/> binary ordering operators and any strongly typed <c>CompareTo(T?)</c> methods
                brought in via <see cref="T:System.IComparable`1"/>. Note that neither <c>operator==</c> nor <c>operator!=</c> is
                evaluated for ordering, as <i>equivalence</i> and <i>equality</i> are treated separately. Appropriate
                symmetry is also assumed: i.e. if testing that <c>A</c> is strictly less than <c>B</c>,
                <see cref="T:Atropos.FullCheck"/> will also test that <c>B</c> is strictly greater than <c>A</c>.
              </para>
              <para>
                <see cref="T:Atropos.FullCheck"/> is intended as a utility for unit testing but is not tied to any particular unit
                testing framework or paradigm. To support the client's choice of testing platform, all of the APIs exposed
                by <see cref="T:Atropos.FullCheck"/> return an optional <see cref="T:System.String"/> denoting the result of the evaluation.
                If the evaluation succeeds (i.e. the test passes), the optional will be a <c>NONE</c> instance. If, on the
                other hand, the evaluation fails (i.e. the test fails), the optional will be a <c>SOME</c> instance that
                contains the failed expression. This allows users to build thin adapters on top of the methods to handle
                failure appropriately, including a useful error message if so desired.

              A utility for ensuring that calls made through a <see cref="T:Moq.Mock`1"/> occur in a specific order.

            <remarks>
              <para>
                A common need when unit testing complex components is to ensure that a series of calls to the system under
                test occur in a particular order. While the <see href="https://github.com/Moq">Moq</see> library provides
                many powerful facilities for mocking objects and evaluating the ensuing behavior, the library is lacking
                when it comes to evaluating call sequences. <see cref="T:Atropos.Moq.CallSequence`1"/> fills this gap, interoperating
                with the <see cref="T:Moq.Mock`1"/> hierarchy seamlessly to provide a fluent way to expect a specific order of
                invocations.

              <para>
                A <see cref="T:Atropos.Moq.CallSequence`1"/> begins empty, i.e. with no expectations, and can be augmented one expected
                call at a time. Any expected call that can be set-up via <see cref="T:Moq.Mock`1"/> can be added to a
                <see cref="T:Atropos.Moq.CallSequence`1"/>. <see cref="T:Atropos.Moq.CallSequence`1"/> imposes a custom callback that verifies the
                calls are made in the correct order. For this reason, however, it is not possible to add an additional
                user-defined callback that is invoked after the order-check passes. This feature is under consideration as
                a future extension of the library. If a call is made out-of-order, an exception is raised with robust
                information regarding the expectation of the <see cref="T:Atropos.Moq.CallSequence`1"/> versus reality.

              <para>
                A <see cref="T:Atropos.Moq.CallSequence`1"/> necessarily imposes an immutable strict total order. This means that an
                expected call cannot be reordered or removed once added, and that every expected call must occur either
                before or after each other expectation. For example, it is not possible to expect that both call <c>A</c>
                and <c>B</c> occur, in any order, before call <c>C</c>. It is, however, possible to expect repeated calls,
                either sequentially (e.g. <c>A</c>, <c>A</c>, <c>B</c>) or non-sequentially  (e.g. <c>A</c>, <c>B</c>,
                <c>A</c>). There are limitations to repeat call support, as detailed below.
              </para>
              <para>
                A <see cref="T:Atropos.Moq.CallSequence`1"/> is in one of three states at any given time: not yet started, incomplete, or
                complete. A <see cref="T:Atropos.Moq.CallSequence`1"/> can be extended in any state, adding an additional expected call
                to the end; specifically, adding an expected call to an incomplete sequence does not set the expectation of
                the next call. A <see cref="T:Atropos.Moq.CallSequence`1"/> is complete when all expected calls have been made; one can
                verify that a <see cref="T:Atropos.Moq.CallSequence`1"/> is complete using a
                <see cref="M:Atropos.Moq.CallSequence`1.VerifyCompleted">dedicated API</see>, which will throw an exception in the adverse case. An
                empty <see cref="T:Atropos.Moq.CallSequence`1"/> (i.e. one without any expected calls) is always considered complete.
              </para>
              <para>
                Calls can be made to the <see cref="T:Moq.Mock`1"/> that backs a <see cref="T:Atropos.Moq.CallSequence`1"/> that are not
                directly expected by the sequence. The strict total order imposed on the calls by a sequence does not
                preclude other calls; to verify that no other calls are made, use a combination of the
                <see cref="M:Atropos.Moq.CallSequence`1.VerifyCompleted"/> method on the <see cref="T:Atropos.Moq.CallSequence`1"/> and the
                <see cref="M:Moq.Mock`1.VerifyNoOtherCalls"/> method on the underlying <see cref="T:Moq.Mock`1"/>.
              </para>
              <para>
                A single <see cref="T:Moq.Mock`1"/> can underlie more than one <see cref="T:Atropos.Moq.CallSequence`1"/> as long as those
                sequences contain disjoint sets of expected calls. If an expected call appears in multiple sequences that
                are backed by the same <see cref="T:Moq.Mock`1"/>, at least one of the sequences will fail. The other major
                limitation of <see cref="T:Atropos.Moq.CallSequence`1"/> has to do with repeat expectations: to include a repeated
                expectation in a sequence, the LINQ expression with which the expectation is established must use the same
                lambda variable names. For example, <c>x => x.Foo()</c> and <c>y => y.Foo()</c>, while representing the
                same invocation, will cause a <see cref="T:Atropos.Moq.CallSequence`1"/> containing both to fail on the first
                invocation. This variable naming is case sensitive, so <c>x => x.Foo()</c> is also different than
                <c>X => X.Foo()</c>.
