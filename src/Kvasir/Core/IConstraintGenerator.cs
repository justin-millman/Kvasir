    ///     The Kvasir framework provides a collection of basic constraints natively as part of its annotation system.
    ///     These constraints can be applied to a single Field by placing the relevant attribute directly on the target
    ///     property, with minimal parametrization available. The set of pre-defined constraints is by no means
    ///     exhaustive, and this mechanic is also limited: it cannot be used to apply a constraint that takes into
    ///     account the values of multiple Fields.

    ///   <para>
    ///     To provide users with the power to define their own constraints outside of the library, Kvasir's annotation
    ///     system allows for the specification of a <i>Type</i> that encapsulates the custom constraint logic. When
    ///     used, the provided Type must implement this interface, which exposes the method necessary to convert one
    ///     or more Fields into the actual constraint. This pattern allows for the re-use of custom constraint classes
    ///     on multiple Fields in the same Entity or in wholly separate Entities altogether; it also permits the use
    ///     of non-compile-time-constants (which are forbidden in C# attributes).
