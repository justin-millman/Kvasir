    ///     A "calculated" Field is one whose value is stored in the back-end database but not loaded therefrom on read
    ///     operations. The value of such a Field is invariably determined by the value of one or more other Fields in
    ///     the same Table; common examples include alphabetization keys, computed averages/percentages, deduced
    ///     geographies, and checksums. Because the value of such a Field is not loaded, the annotated property does
    ///     not participate in construction resolution.
