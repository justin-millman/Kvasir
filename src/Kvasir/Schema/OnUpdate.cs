    ///   Foreign Keys are intended to enforce data integrity across multiple Tables, ensuring that a value (or tuple
    ///   of values) in one Table references a row in another. <c>UPDATE</c> operations can therefore disrupt the
    ///   validity of Foreign Keys, as the row(s) being updated can feasibly be one referenced by a Foreign Key in
    ///   another Table. When this happens, the behavior is controlled by the <c>ON UPDATE</c> behavior of the Foreign
    ///   Key that referenes the to-be-updated row(s). If multiple Foreign Keys reference the targeted row(s) with
    ///   different <c>ON UPDATE</c> behavior, the result depends on the back-end RDBMS provider being used.
