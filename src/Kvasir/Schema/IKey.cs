    ///     In a relational database, a Key is a non-empty, possibly proper subset of a Table's Fields that are
    ///     required to form a unique tuple for each row in that Table. Keys often reflect real-world domain identity
    ///     relations, such as social security numbers, client usernames, or any of various IDs. Key uniqueness is
    ///     imposed by the database provider, rejecting <c>INSERT</c> and <c>UPDATE</c> statements that would create
    ///     multiple rows with the same tuple of values.

    ///     This interface is closed: it can only be implemented by types in the Kvasir assembly. It is guaranteed that
    ///     at least on type in the Kvasir assembly implements this interface, though the upper bound is unspecified.
    ///     External assemblies can reference, use, and extend the interface to add cursory functionality and enrich
    ///     their own APIs if desired.
