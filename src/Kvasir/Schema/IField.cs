    /// <remarks>
    ///   <para>
    ///     Fields in a relational database are analogous to columns in the two-dimensional matrix that is a Table.
    ///     Each Field has, at a minimum, a name, data type, and nullability; collectively, this metadata controls how
    ///     the Field is referenced by other Tables and SQL statements/expressions and what values are allowed for the
    ///     Field. Additionally, a Field can have a default value that is used when the Field is omitted from an
    ///     <c>INSERT</c> statement.
    ///   </para>
    ///   <para>
    ///     The representation of Fields at the Schema Layer of Kvasir is an abstraction over the actual realization of
    ///     the Field in a back-end RDBMS. Specifically, the data type of a Field is specified in a storage-agnostic
    ///     manner that makes no guarantees as to the actual back-end storage mechanisms. For example, the data type of
    ///     a Field does not manage the precision of floating-point values or the master domain of integers. These
    ///     aspects of the data type can differ from provider to provider; the abstract representation of the Field
    ///     therefore allows a single Schema translation to be used for any back-end RDBMS provider.

    ///     This interface is closed: it can only be implemented by types in the Kvasir assembly. It is guaranteed that
    ///     at least on type in the Kvasir assembly implements this interface, though the upper bound is unspecified.
    ///     External assemblies can reference, use, and extend the interface to add cursory functionality and enrich
    ///     their own APIs if desired.
