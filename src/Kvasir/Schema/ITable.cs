    ///   <para>
    ///     A Table is the primary unit of organization in a relational database. Each Table can be thought of as a
    ///     two-dimensional matrix of data, where the columns are Fields and the rows are data entries. A Table is
    ///     principally defined by its name and the collection of constitutent Fields; additionally, every Table must
    ///     have exactly one Primary Key - a tuple of Fields that must be unique for all member rows. Tables can
    ///     also have Candidate Keys, which are tuples that <i>could</i> be a Primary Key but just aren't.
    ///   </para>
    ///   <para>
    ///     The structure of a Table can also impose restrictions on the values of its Fields, on top of the implicit
    ///     and/or explicit restrictions imposed by the data type of the Fields themselves. The first form of
    ///     constraint is the Foreign Key constraint, which requires that the values of a tuple of Fields match the
    ///     values of a Primary Key for some data entry row in another Table; this constraint imposes referential
    ///     integrity. The second form of constraint is the <c>CHECK</c> constraint, which allows the specification of
    ///     arbitrary conditional logic on the values of the Fields in a row of data. A Table can have any number of
    ///     either type of constraint, including none at all.
    ///   </para>
    ///   <para>
    ///     This interface is closed: it can only be implemented by types in the Kvasir assembly. It is guaranteed that
    ///     at least on type in the Kvasir assembly implements this interface, though the upper bound is unspecified.
    ///     External assemblies can reference, use, and extend the interface to add cursory functionality and enrich
    ///     their own APIs if desired.
